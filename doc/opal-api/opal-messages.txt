OAPL_MESSAGE
============

The host OS can use OPAL_GET_MSG to retrive messages queued by OPAL. The
messages are defined by enum opal_msg_type. The host is notified of there
being messages to be consumed by the OPAL_EVENT_MSG_PENDING bit being set.

An opal_msg is:
struct opal_msg {
	__be32 msg_type;
	__be32 reserved;
	__be64 params[8];
};

The data structure is ALWAYS at least this size (4+4+8*8 = 72 bytes). Some
messages define fewer than eight parameters. For messages that do not
define all eight parameters, the value in the undefined parameters is
undefined, although can safely be memcpy()d or otherwise moved.

In the device tree, there's an opal-msg-size property of the OPAL node that
says the size of a struct opal-msg. In the future, OPAL may support larger
messages. See OPAL_GET_MESSAGE documentation for details.

  ibm,opal {
            opal-msg-size = <0x48>;
  }


OPAL_MSG_ASYNC_COMP
-------------------

params[0] = token
params[1] = rc

Additional parameters are function-specific.

OPAL_MSG_MEM_ERR
----------------

OPAL_MSG_EPOW
-------------

OPAL_MSG_SHUTDOWN
-----------------

Used by OPAL to inform the host OS it must imitate a graceful shutdown. Uses
the first parameter to indicate weather the system is going down for shutdown
or a reboot.

params[0] = 0x01 reboot, 0x00 shutdown

OPAL_MSG_HMI_EVT
----------------

Sends the OPAL HMI Event to the host OS

TODO: Describe what HMI is

struct OpalHMIEvent {
        uint8_t         version;        /* 0x00 */
        uint8_t         severity;       /* 0x01 */
        uint8_t         type;           /* 0x02 */
        uint8_t         disposition;    /* 0x03 */
        uint8_t         reserved_1[4];  /* 0x04 */

        uint64_t        hmer;
        /* TFMR register. Valid only for TFAC and TFMR_PARITY error type. */
        uint64_t        tfmr;
};


OPAL_MSG_DPO
------------

Used for delayed power off, where OPAL can inform a host OS that it intends to
perform a shutdown in the future.

The host OS can use the separate API OPAL_GET_DPO_STATUS to query OPAL for the
number of seconds before a forced shutdown will occur.
