ibm,opal/power-mgt device tree entries
--------------------------------------

All available CPU idle states are listed in ibm,cpu-idle-state-names

For example:
ibm,cpu-idle-state-names = "nap", "fastsleep_", "winkle";

The idle states are characterized by latency and residency
numbers which determine the breakeven point for entry into them. The
latency is a measure of the exit overhead from the idle state and
residency is the minimum amount of time that a CPU must be predicted
to be idle so as to reap the powersavings from entering into that idle
state.

These numbers are made use of by the cpuidle governors in the kernel to
arrive at the appropriate idle state that a CPU must enter into when there is
no work to be done. The values in ibm,cpu-idle-state-latencies-ns are the
the measured latency numbers for the idle states. The residency numbers have
been arrived at experimentally after ensuring that the performance of latency
sensitive workloads do not regress while allowing deeper idle states to be
entered into during low load situations. The kernel is expected to use these
values for optimal power efficiency.
 
ibm,cpu-idle-state-residency-ns = <0x1 0x2 0x3>
ibm,cpu-idle-state-latencies-ns = <0x1 0x2 0x3>

ibm,pstate-vcss ibm,pstate-vdds
-------------------------------

During characterisation, we'd like to allow userspace to see the vdd and
vcs values exposed by the OCC. This change adds two new properties to
expose these:
    
 ibm,pstate-vdds
 ibm,pstate-vcss

- containing one byte per pstate, representing the Vdd or Vcs value for
  that pstate.
